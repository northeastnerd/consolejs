# consolejs
Web widget to model retro computer console (print and input interface). This is a zero dependency, client side only browser console in pure javascript. It uses an HTML5 canvas and keystroke processing to implement an editable text space. I did it because it was fun, it works for me, your mileage may vary. Usage is pretty simple:

  1) create a new consolejs object with desired dimensions and colors
  2) call print or input
  3) that's it
  
It does not scroll right now though that doesn't seem complicated. FWIW my retro computer consoles don't scroll either, so it seems true to concept.

A search for console, jsconsole or consolejs shows a million hits, probably some with prettier and fancier coding style than this, so use it if you like...

There is a live demo of the example in HTML here:
